# User Authentication and Group Authorization API for Entity Framework Core 3 (CTP) - App Security Made Easy

This branch is under construction and our goal is to help DevExpress and non-DevExpress customers benefit from [XAF's Security System](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/113366/concepts/security-system) and the Microsoft EF Core ORM. We added a secured Object Space for EF Core 3.1+ and demonstrated its use for basic CRUD operations in **[Console](EFCore/Console/)** and **[WinForms](EFCore/WinForms/)** apps.

For more information on XAF's user authentication and group authorization APIs for .NET Core and .NET Framework apps, please review the diagram below, [Frequently Asked Questions](https://supportcenter.devexpress.com/ticket/details/t886740/faq-xaf-user-authentication-and-group-authorization-api-for-devexpress-xpo-and-microsoft)
and this [feature overview](https://www.devexpress.com/go/XAF_Security_NonXAF_Series.aspx).

If you cannot compile or run any of these demo apps or have questions about our tutorials or supported functionality, please submit questions in the [Support Center](https://www.devexpress.com/ask) or [the Issues tab above](https://github.com/DevExpress-Examples/XAF_how-to-use-the-integrated-mode-of-the-security-system-in-non-xaf-applications-e4908/issues) - we will be more than happy to help you.

**NOTE**: The *DevExpress.ExpressApp.EFCore* NuGet package is available as a [Community Technology Preview (CTP)](https://www.devexpress.com/aboutus/pre-release.xml) and is not ready for production. We've made it available to gather feedback and engage those of you considering it for future use.
