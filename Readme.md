# User Authentication and Group Authorization API for Entity Framework Core Apps (CTP) - App Security Made Easy

This branch is under construction and our goal is to help DevExpress and non-DevExpress customers benefit from [XAF's Security System](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/113366/concepts/security-system) and the Microsoft EF Core ORM. We added a secured Object Space for EF Core 3.1+ and demonstrated its use for basic CRUD operations in **[Console](EFCore/Console/)** and **[WinForms](EFCore/WinForms/)** apps.

Note that the current version of the *DevExpress.EntityFrameworkCore.Security* library has the [Community Technology Preview(CTP)](https://www.devexpress.com/aboutus/pre-release.xml) status and is not intended for use in production code.
 
For more information on XAF's user authentication and group authorization APIs for .NET Core and .NET Framework apps, please refer to the diagram below and [this feature overview](https://www.devexpress.com/go/XAF_Security_NonXAF_Series.aspx).
